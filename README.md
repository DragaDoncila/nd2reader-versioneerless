## Simple access to hierarchical .nd2 files 

# About

.nd2 files contain hierarchical image data, which can be split along multiple axes: time, fields of view, focus, and filter channel. Maybe others as well?
This packages allows you to view how the data is organized, and to extract the image data from a particular set of the hierarchy. 

Images are numpy arrays.

# Dependencies

numpy 

# Installation

I'll write this eventually.
